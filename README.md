Baby Weight Shiny App
================

This repo describes a Docker orchestration of a R Shiny App and database to keep
track of my son's weight gain profile.

The app is for personal use only and should never be used to replace
professional medical advice.

## Initiation

After installing Docker and docker-compose, images can be built and the app
launched by entering this into bash

    sh \path\to\diccectory\setup.sh
